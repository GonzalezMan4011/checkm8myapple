# checkm8_app
A app that just runs the checkm8 bootrom exploit on any compatible device at any time if needed. Works on macOS only. THE END

# Supported devices
Any device with the Apple A5-A11 processor should work fine. Just note that the S3, S5L8747, and (certain) T2 chips (as stated by this [theiphonewiki page](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit)) will never be supported by this tool as it's not really a necessity for this app. If you need to run it on those, please use a different tool.
